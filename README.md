# Human Activity Recognition using Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for human activity recognition (HAR). The model is designed to classify different human activities based on sensor data, using deep learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes steps for loading and preprocessing the sensor data, including normalizing and reshaping the data for input into the model.
- **Model Architecture**: A hybrid CNN-LSTM model is used, where the CNN layers extract features from the time series data, and the LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies.
- **Evaluation**: The notebook evaluates the model using various metrics such as accuracy and classification report, helping assess the model's performance on the test data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
